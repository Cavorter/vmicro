This is a simple tower in the "brutalist" or "heroic" style from the middle of the 20th century. In particular I wanted to make use of the large 8x16 tiles to emulate the characteristic blank facades with the slightly sinuous line of windows that run up and down the structure around them. It is also particularly representative of my highly modular building style where there are 3 (or possibly 4 since on of them is mirrored) basic structures used to construct the whole with some basic decoration to complete the look. Similar to [Blackrock Center](blackrock-center) and [Dudley Plaza](dudley-plaza) this building ended up being an early prototype for later techniques I would use in the [March Tower](march-tower).
