# Virtual Micropolis

This is a [hugo](https://gohugo.io) project to generate the site hosted at https://virtualmicropolis.com replacing an older version of the site hosted using DokuWiki. I generally like DokuWiki but am trying to get away from hosting sites using server-side content unless absolutely necessary so when it stopped rendering properly because of an update in my shared hosting server it was time to shift to something new.

I didn't find a theme that I liked particularly well for this particular project so I did the relatively crazy thing and built everything from scratch. After I write this I will likely start liberally borrowing bits and pieces from various themes and blog posts so will not claim any of the site design as original in any way, just the content.
